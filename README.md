# Pneumonia Detection Model

## Overview

Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death in children under five, particularly in low-resource settings. Accurate and timely diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. This project focuses on developing a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect pneumonia from pediatric chest X-ray images. By leveraging transfer learning, the model will classify X-ray images into categories indicating the presence or absence of pneumonia, assisting healthcare professionals in making quick and accurate diagnoses.

This repository contains a deep learning model for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model leverages a fine-tuned DenseNet121 architecture and a custom convolutional neural network to classify images into "Normal" and "Pneumonia" categories. It is designed to assist in early diagnosis by analyzing medical imaging data.

## Model Details

- **Base Model:** Fine-tuned DenseNet121
- **Custom Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Accuracy:** 91%
- **High Recall:** 95% for pneumonia detection
- **Balanced Precision:** Reliable diagnostics for both classes

## Key Features

- **Effective Screening:** High recall enables identification of most pneumonia cases.
- **Balanced Results:** Good precision and recall reduce false positives and negatives.
- **Integration Ready:** Supports integration with healthcare diagnostics.

## Recommendations

- **Integrate:** Deploy the model to assist healthcare professionals in diagnostics.
- **Update Regularly:** Continuously monitor and retrain with new data.
- **Collaborate:** Engage with medical experts to refine and validate model predictions.
